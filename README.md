"I lost my mind in this game..like Vincent van Gogh. He dedicated his life to his craft and lost his mind in the process. That's happening to me. But, fuck it. When that gold belt is around my waist, when my mother has a big mansion, when my girlfriend has a different car for every day of the week, when my kids' kids have everything they ever want, then it will pay."
